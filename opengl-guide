OpenGL (...in Common Lisp)

Sup. Today, all of you will (hopefully) write code that uses the OpenGL core profile to draw a triangle to the screen. Before that, however, let's get two things out of the way:

(1) I do not know OpenGL nearly as well as Common Lisp, and as such, this talk is going to vaguely resemble the Arc Synthesis OpenGL tutorials by Jason McKesson (https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gltut/wiki/Home). It's an excellent tutorial, and I recommend reading through it as well as Learn OpenGL by Joey de Vries (http://learnopengl.com/).
